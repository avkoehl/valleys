save dem and nhdhr flowlines for huc12 in toydata

add get_flowlines_and_dem to utils


input:
    flowlines_nhd
    dem
    
    wbt_exe_path
    wbt_work_dir


1. get flowlines and dem for huc12 - save to working dir
2. get_aligned_streams
3. compute_terrain_rasters (slope, aspect, curvature, hand, subbasins)
    - check for dem, streams.tif in working dir
4. for stream in streams:
    - get xsections
    - for xs in xsections:
	- reset alpha to streamline
	- get curvature profile
	- get break points
	- get top points

    - get HAND threshold value
    - get polygon for valley boundary using HAND threshold and subbasin
    - return: top_points, HAND_threshold, valley_boundary
